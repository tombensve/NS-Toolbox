# NS-Toolbox

This is a project of tools that I use in other projects.

It is made up of several jars rather than one fat jar, so only what is needed can be used.

This will probably grow over time.

Each tool has its own submodule. See Readme.md in each for more info.

Due to a bad versioning descision I have now bumped all versions to 2.0.0 to start over, and from now on only submodules that have been changed will have a version bump. This also means that the version of the base module will only be bumped on adding new modules or making other changes in root pom.
