# ASF Licence Annotation

This jar contains one annotation `@Apache_Software_Licence_2_0`. All classes, interfaces, 
etc should be annotated with this. The annotation will be retained in the binary, but only 
once of course. 

In IDEs like IDEA you can Alt/COMMAND/... click the annotation and get the annotation text 
within the annotation.

The idea here is to make it much easier to include this text on each file by use
of annotation. Note however that the actual licence text only resides within the
annotation! It is easy to access it by Ctrl-clicking the annotation which will produce
the text.

**!!! DO NOTE THAT I'M NOT SURE THAT THIS WORKS LEGALLY !!!**

**I'm not an expert here! But I find this easier, and you get this text included once in binary jar!**

**You should always include the actual license document also! This is only intended to replace the comment header in each source file.**

With this however the licence text will exist within each binary jar file!
