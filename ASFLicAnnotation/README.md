# ASFLicAnnotation

This jar contains one annotation `@Apache_Software_Licence_2_0`. All classes, interfaces, 
etc should be annotated with this. The annotation will be retained in the binary, but only 
once of course. 

In IDEs like IDEA you can Alt/COMMAND/... click the annotation and get the annotation text i
within the annotation.

The idea here is to make it much easier to include this text on each file by use
of annotation. Note however that the actual licence text only resides within the
annotation! It is easy to access it by Ctrl-clicking the annotation which will produce
the text.

**NOTE: I'm not entirely 100% sure that the licence rules have taken such in consideration!**

With this however the licence text will exist within each binary jar file!
